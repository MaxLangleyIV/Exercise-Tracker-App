User Stories - Initial Draft:

1. As a user I want to record my exercises performed in a database, so that I may reference and analyze them later.

Acceptance Tests:
As a user I can mark an exercise as completed and it will be added to the database of completed exercises.
If I close and open the app the completed exercises will persist.
As a user I can view a list of the completed exercises I have marked as completed.
