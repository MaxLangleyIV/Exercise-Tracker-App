Iteration 0
Duration: 1 week

Backlog Items:
1. As a user I want to browse a list of predefined exercises, so that I may select one to read and / or perform.

2. As a user I want to browse a list of predefined exercise routines, so that I may select one to follow as a series of exercises for a given days session.

High Level Steps:
1. Design layout for exercise library.
2. Design format for exercises and for exercise records (What sort of data might one have which the other will not?)
3. Build a repository of default exercises to populate the library following the format from step 2.
