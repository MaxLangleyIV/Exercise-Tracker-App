Iteration 0
Duration: 1 week

Backlog Items:
1. As a user I want to browse a list of predefined exercises, so that I may select one to read and / or perform.
7. As a user I want to record exercises performed in a database, so that I may reference and analyze them later.

High Level Steps:
1. Design layout for exercise library.
2. Design format for exercises and for exercise records (What sort of data might one have which the other will not?)
3. Build a repository of default exercises to populate the library following the format from step 2.
4. Implement database to hold exercises and exercise records.
5. Implement exercise library UI.
6. Implement exercise recording UI.
