# Exercise-Tracker-App
 Android application for tracking your workouts and relevant metrics. Replacing tradition hand written journal logs with an intuitive exercise tracking application. 

 Requirements:
 1. Record exercises performed (similar to how they may be recorded in a workout journal, with sets, reps, weight used, and other potential attributes).
 2. Select from predefined common exercises.
 3. Input custom exercises.
 4. Create a workout routine from defined or custom exercises.
 5. Allow the user to queued up a routine so that during a workout you only need to press a single button to record the set and move to the next.
 6. Optional: Provide a cooldown timer when a set is marked as completed.
 7. Allow the user to create a schedule of routines, and the app should keep track of what day of the schedule the user is on.
    The schedule can be day specific or simply a cycle with no tie to any specific day or day interval.
